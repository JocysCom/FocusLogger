# Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot

Create a file that automatically adds information to all questions you ask GitHub Copilot Chat.

With GitHub Copilot, you can receive chat responses tailored to your team'ss workflow, preferred tools, and project specifics - simply by providing context. Instead of adding this contextual detail to each chat query, you can create a file that supplies this information automatically. While this additional context won't appear in the chat, it is available to GitHub Copilot, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant responses.

## How to Enable Custom Instructions

Enable the feature via Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > and check (Preview) Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/copilot-instructions.md files and added to requests.
Add copilot-instruction.md in the root of your respository inside the .github file, create the file if it doesn't already exist.
